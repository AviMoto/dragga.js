For instance:\r\n\r\n$('#myDragElement').dragga();\r\n\r\nNote that the element must also define the 'x' class, 'y' class or 'xy' class in order to determine the available axis for dragging. For more detailed sample please open '1.drag.html' file in your browser as well as in your code editor\r\n\r\n\r\ngestures\r\n---------\r\n\r\nCapturing gestures is also available, once you control the listeners for every drag element. Basically, each element has 3 main listeners:\r\n\r\nstart - when the drag (or gesture) begins\r\ndrag - when you drag an element or drag your finger around\r\nend - when you finish dragging stuff around\r\n\r\nNote that the element itself shouldn't has any class of 'x', 'y' or 'xy' when you create a gesture - these settings are for dragging elements only! More detailed sample can be found at '2.gesture.html'\r\n\r\n\r\nnow what?\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThere are more samples to play with... fell free to explore them and check their relevancy to your projects\r\n\r\nEnjoy :)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
